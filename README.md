Rails-Cars
==========

I made this rails app to help me keep track of my vehicles, cars, bikes, motorcycles, etc...

To create a new user user, do the following!

rake car_app:add_user

My working implementation is at https://cars.xcelor8.com/ (site signed with a CAcert certificate. http://www.cacert.org/)
